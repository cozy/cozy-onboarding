[Cozy] Onboarding
=======================


What's Cozy?
------------

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.


What's Onboarding?
------------------

Cozy Onboarding helps users to register and configure their cozy the first time they access to it.


## Hack

To be hacked, the Cozy Proxy dev environment requires that a CouchDB instance
and a Cozy Data System instance are running. Then you can start the Cozy Proxy
this way:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-onboarding-v3.git
$ cd cozy-onboarding-v3
$ yarn install
$ yarn watch
```

### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [chai] and [sinon]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd cozy-onboarding-v3
$ yarn test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx], which is used by all Cozy's apps.

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim an access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must [configure the transifex client][tx-client], and claim an access as _maintainer_ is the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push -s` command.


### Get in touch

You can reach the Cozy Community by:
